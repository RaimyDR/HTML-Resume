<h3>Kimetsu no Yaiba</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite animes since the story is really entertaining and the animation really spectacular. Story's about Tanjiro, a regular demon hunter looking for transforming his demon sister back to normal.</p>

<h3>Jujutsu Kaisen</h3>   
<p>Very similar to the last one, however, this one is about Yuji, a regular sorcerer that is looking to eat all 20 fingers of the Curse King Sukuna, to be able to contain it within him and exorcise him</p>
